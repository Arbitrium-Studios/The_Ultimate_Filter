# About `The Ultimate Filter` Repository:

> I know how frustrating it is to put together a filter to protect your community from trolls and other trouble makers. So, as a part of the Better Together Project, The Ultimate Filter is not meant to target anyone but instead prevent these words from being used. Unfortunately, this repository does **__NOT__** contain an actual filter application. However, I recommend using [Better-Profanity] if you haven't made one of your own.

## Things to Note:

1. Please use this respectfully and don't hate on people who use these words. The last thing this world needs is more hate. Also, feel free to give credit though, I don't require that because, this sort of thing should be free for all to use to protect their community online.
2. If you are the owners of either of the repositories and you don't want this to be up, then I can take it down. Just post an issue and I'll take note!
3. If you're using `The Ultimate Filter.txt`, be warned that the list may be a bit to restrictive depending on how you set it up.
4. This is compatiable with [Better-Profanity]

## Discord Setup:

1. Clone this Repository (If you don't know how to do that, [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git) is how you can set that up)
2. Go to the location where you cloned the repository
3. Open the file of your choice
4. Remove the lines that you wish to not censor

    5b. Select all, copy (see step 6 is you're confused), then paste the text into the left box)
    5c. Go back to your chosen text editor and paste the text
    5d. Find the "Replace All" button
    5e. In the top box, only put a comma (should look like this: `,`) and in the bottom box, put a command and a space (should look like this: `, `) then replace all of the text.
6. Select All (CTRL+A) and Copy (CTRL+C) the text.
