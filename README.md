# Ultimate Blacklist Repository

> I know how frustrating it is to put together a filter to protect your community from trolls and other trouble makers. So, as a part of the Better Together Project, The Ultimate Blacklist is not meant to target anyone but instead prevent these words from being used. Unfortunately, this repository does **__NOT__** contain an actual filter application. However, I recommend using [BetterProfanity] if you haven't made one of your own.

## Things to Note:

1. Please use this respectfully and don't hate on people who use these words. The last thing this world needs is more hate. Also, feel free to give credit though, I don't require that because, this sort of thing should be free for all to use to protect their community online.
2. If you are the owners of either of the repositories and you don't want this to be up, then I can take it down. Just post an issue and I'll take note!
3. If you're using `Ultimate Blacklist.txt`, be warned that the list may be a bit to restrictive depending on how you set it up.
4. The `Ultimate Blacklist.txt` and `Ultimate Blacklist but on one line.txt` files contain a list of a good chunk of EVERY offensive, innapropriate, and sexual words in the entire history of written language! Continue into these files at your own peril.
