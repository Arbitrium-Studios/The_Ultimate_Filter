# Ultimate Blacklist
The Ultimate Blacklist is not meant to target anyone but instead should be used by companies to make social settings safe for everyone! This is NOT a filter but is a list of words meant to be formatted to be used with a filter like [BetterProfanity] or a home made filter of your own.

As a part of the Better Together Project, I know how frustrating it is to put together a filter to protect your community from trolls. So, I made The Ultimate Blacklist in hopes that people will use the words in the `Ultimate Blacklist.txt` file to protect their own community like I protect mine!

### Note from Author:

Please use this respectfully and don't hate on people who use these words. The last thing this world needs is more hate. Also, feel free to give credit though, I don't require that because, this sort of thing should be free for all to use to protect their community online.

### Trigger Warning:

This list contains a list of nearly EVERY offensive, innapropriate, and sexual words in the entire English language and beyond! Continue into these files at your own peril.

### Credits:

[BetterProfanity] for the base list of swear words, [Zacanger] for the additional list of words, and [LDNOOBW] for the swear words from the other languages!
